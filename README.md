<h1>JavaScript</h1>

<p>Not to be confused with Java (programming language), Javanese script, or ECMAScript.</p>
<p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. As of 2025, the overwhelming majority of websites (98.9%) uses JavaScript for client side webpage behavior.</p>
<p>Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
<p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
<p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

<h1>Web API Security</h1>
Web API security entails authenticating programs or users who are invoking a web API.

Along with the ease of API integrations come the difficulties of ensuring proper authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ). In a multitenant environment, security controls based on proper AuthN and AuthZ can help ensure that API access is limited to those who need (and are entitled to) it. Appropriate AuthN schemes enable producers (APIs or services) to properly identify consumers (clients or calling programs), and to evaluate their access level (AuthZ). In other words, may a consumer invoke a particular method (business logic) based on the credentials presented?
